# Getting started in **Github**
This week, we created github accounts, learn some commands and build repositories.
Thus, we decided to create a github with a **package.json** and an **index.js**.
If you want to learn more about this project, you can access the [module 1 assignment instructions](https://uciunex.instructure.com/courses/16458/assignments/200842).

My _index.js_ file is a website welcoming you on my server.

### How it works ?
- First, you need to clone the repository using the command : **git clone**
- Then, you can run _index.js_ using this command : **npm run script**
- Afterwards, **you enter your name in the Git Bash** (it's not necessary but if you want your name to be displayed, you can do it).
- You open your browser and search "**localhost:3000**".

# Name of our Project : **_BattleShip Wars_**
Our project consists in a simple battleship. In our game, there will be a login page and a shop using a data base.
Furthermore, the user will be able to edit his profile, to update it and to delete it.
Moreover, during the game, the user will earn points and will be able to use them in the shop where he will buy some weapons.
Besides, there will be a ranking in it.
Finally, our website will keep data and statistics of the players.
